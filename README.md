BREAKOUT BALL GAME IN JAVA

Breakout Ball Game is widely used game which was developed in the 1970s. In Breakout ball game a layer of bricks lines the top third screen 
and the goal is to destroy them all. A ball moves straight around the screen bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen. when a brick is 
hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen; to prevent this
from happening, the player has a horizontal movable paddle to bounce ball upward, keeping it in play. The palyer uses the platform to keep
the ball running. The goal is to break the bricks without missing the ball with your platform. 
The project makes use of Java swing, OOPS concepts and much more (AWT,Swing,JFrame,Jpanel).

Functional Components Of the Project-
The player should be able to start the game in the terminal by pressing the ENTER key.
The player should be able to move the paddle sideways using the Leftwards and the Rightwards Arrow on the keyboard.
Once the player loses the ball, i.e. when the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends.
Breaking each brick provides the player a certain number of points.
Once the game ends, the terminal will present the final score of the player and give him the option to restart the game again.
